# By default the fetch type is Lazy.
# If we have specified Select as fetch mode, it will be used to get data, FetchType will be honored as it is.
# join + lazy = eager
# In scenarios, where we are asking for one category, it will not run any SUBSELECT queries because that case can be handled with two select queries
# If fetch mode is join, fetch type does not matter
# If fetch mode is select and subselect, fetch type does matter
